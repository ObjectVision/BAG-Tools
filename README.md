NOTE!!!: We noticed some isses related to the woonpandtypering with the latets version of the BAG-Tools, we hope to solve them soon and make a new GeoDMS version available. We advice not to use the current version of the tools to make the woonpandtypering.


The BAG Toolkit is used to model with the BAG. See the [wiki](https://github.com/ObjectVision/BAG-Tools/wiki) for more information.
